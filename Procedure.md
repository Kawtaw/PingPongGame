In my ping pong game, two player control each paddles, one on the left and one on the right
with W,A and UP,Down Key. The ball is spawn and travel in a randomly generated direction. Player
must bounce the ball away by blocking it with their paddle, if a ball goes through either player
side, the other person will gain a point. The ball slowly moves faster over time. First player 
to score 3 goal wins.
